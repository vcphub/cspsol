		cspsol: Release Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Tuesday, 02 March 2010. Version 1.02 Released.

Major changes and features in this release are : 

1. Initial pattern generation : Trivial logic is replaced with 
First Fit Decreasing (FFD) heuristic. FFD heuristic also provides
integer solution bound for pruning B&B tree.

2. Improve testing framework. Added more BPP test cases. Got 
improved results.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Wednesday, 23 February 2010. Version 1.01 Released.

Major changes and features in this release are : 

1. Resolved issues with --si mode (solves subproblem using MIP solver,
instead of default dynamic programming algorithm.)

2. Generating initial patterns : using first first decresing (FFD) 
heuristics. Getting very good upper bounds and significant improvement 
in the benchmarks.

3. Support for new command line option '--tmlim' 
 3.1. User can now specify time limit on total runtime, in seconds. 
 3.2. If interger solution is found in time limit then solution
 report is printed.

4. Silent mode and log file feature. 
 4.1. Silent mode (--silent) shuns any output to 'cout'. Neither to terminal 
nor to a file. Errors to 'cerr' should be printed. 
 4.2. Terminal output could be re-directed to user specified file using command 
line option '--log filename'.  Similar to glpsol, however not a copy of 
terminal output but redirection. 

5. New BPP test cases included in benchmarks. All benchmarks should be 
available on wiki page :
http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/wiki/Benchmarks101

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Wednesday, 20 January 2010. Version 1.0 Released.

This release consists of major bug fixes and other improvements.

1. Fixed major memory leak bug in DP algorithm. Thanks to Jonathan Mitchell
for reporting the problem and Francesco (ilpanda) for helping in 
identifying the cause & testing.

2. Unnecessary BB nodes are not deleted, reducing memory usage. Thanks to 
Francesco for suggestion.

3. Update CSP and BPP test case specs file. Added BPP instances.

4. Added copy of GNU GPL version 3 license.

5. Design document was updated and improved. While creating the document, 
code was reviewed, refactored and comments were added.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Monday, 22 September 2008. Version 0.9 Released.

New features were added in this release.

1. By default, column generation (CG) is now done at every node of 
Branch & Bound (BB) tree. Main objective behind adding this feature 
was to avoid generating multiple integer optimal solutions for subproblem, 
which consumes memory and time resources. 

I got mixed results, we still need to generate multiple solutions 
to subproblem. More work is needed on this issue.

2. Added new command line option '--cgroot'. If this option is used
then CG is done only at root node. By default CG is done at every
node of BB tree.

3. Added new command line option '--bpp', which reads input data file
in BPP format. Added sample test case specification file 'data/bpcases.txt' 

Actual test cases should be downloaded from:
http://www.wiwi.uni-jena.de/Entscheidung/binpp/index.htm

4. Testing: Various test benchmarks will be soon published at:
http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/wiki/Benchmarks09

5. Other changes to make code more readable and consistent with 
design document.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Saturday, 30 August 2008. Version 0.8 Released.

This release addresses issues faced while solving large input.

BUG fix: Fixed bug in logic related to option --test. 

Introduced commandline option '-Olevel' to control optimization 
level (how close solution is to true optimal). Valid values 
of level are 1, 2 and 3. Default value is 1.0

This value of optimization level controls number of solutions
stored (in memory) while solving knapsack problem. This in turn 
determines the runtime and memory consumed.

Higher value of level means more number of solutions are stored, 
and requires higher runtime and more memory. Higher value of level
is likely to produce all patterns and hence final solution will be
closer to true optimal integer solution. For example:

$ cspsol -d ../data/case6.txt
Best integer obj. func. value = 6

$ cspsol -O3 -d ../data/case6.txt
Best integer obj. func. value = 5

Future plan: To get true optimal solutions in reasonable time, we need
make following changes:

- Use column generation to generate patterns at each node of branch and 
bound tree. Right now we do it only for root node.

- Generate only one optimal solution to knapsack sub-problem. Right now
we have multiple optimal solutions, which causes exponential increase in
memory required to store all solutions.

- Store generating pattern is reduced cost of generated pattern is greater 
than 0.0. Right now we do it till no new pattern is generated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Friday, 22 August 2008. Version 0.7 Released.

This release contains a bug fix and new features for users and developers.

1. Uninitialized variable caused a bug in last version. Fixed it.
Thanks to Guillaume Jacquenot for bug reports and patience.

2. Henry Palonen completed XML solution report feature.
Related command line option '--oxml filename' was introduced in last version.
Thanks Henry.

3. For developers interested in testing cspsol against different test
cases, added new feature do make this easy.

New command line option '--test filename' runs all test cases specified
in the test specification file 'filename'. The filename format is:

N
order-data-file-name1 expected_opt_value1
order-data-file-name2 expected_opt_value2
order-data-file-nameN expected_opt_valueN
 
where N is number of test cases. Sample test specs file and test cases
can be found in directory cspsol/data. 

$ cat allcases.txt 
6
case1.txt 2
case2.txt 32
case3.txt 15
case4.txt 18
case5.txt 9
case6.txt 4
$
$ cspsol --test allcases.txt.
Solving testcase no. 1... Done. 
Testcase: 1 Expected = 2, Actual = 2 PASS

Solving testcase no. 2... Done. 
Testcase: 2 Expected = 32, Actual = 32 PASS

Solving testcase no. 3... Done. 
Testcase: 3 Expected = 15, Actual = 15 PASS

Solving testcase no. 4... Done. 
Testcase: 4 Expected = 18, Actual = 18 PASS

Solving testcase no. 5... Done. 
Testcase: 5 Expected = 9, Actual = 9 PASS

Solving testcase no. 6... Done. 
Testcase: 6 Expected = 4, Actual = 4 PASS

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Wednesday, 20 August 2008. Version 0.6 Released.

Contains new features.

1. Added new command line options --silent, --otext, --oxml.
Options --otext and --oxml can be used to generate output solution 
report in text and xml formats. 

2. If input file name is 'stdin' then input is read from standard
input. For example:

$cat input.txt | cspsol -d stdin

3. For options, --otext, --oxml, if output file name is 'stdout' 
then solution report is printed to standard output.

4. Option will --silent will not print any progress messages on
standard output. However if options --otext or --oxml specify 'stdout' as 
filename then solution will be printed on standard output.

5. By default (cspsol -d input.txt), progress messages and solution report 
are printed to standard output.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Monday, 18 August 2008. Version 0.5 Released.

This release contains a long term solution to fix issue:
http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/issues/detail?id=1

The subproblem (knapsack problem) is now solved by dynamic programming (DP)
algorithm. Quality of solution is given importance over total runtime. 
Having access to all optimal integer solutions (which are used to generate 
a new pattern) obtained using DP solves the issue.

In the input data file, order widths and max. order width must be INTEGERs, in
order for DP algorithm to work correctly. By default, this version does not
require any modifications to GLPK source code.

[Testcase]

$ cspsol -d o1.txt 

Reading order data from file o1.txt
Total orders read from file = 2
2000 4
1000 4
Add order demand constraints. Total rows, cols = 2, 0
Added initial patterns. Total rows, cols = 2, 2
Node    1: new patterns =    4 Obj Func Value = 2 Branch.
Node    2: new patterns =    0 Obj Func Value = 2.33333 Branch.
Node    3: new patterns =    0 Obj Func Value = 2 INTEGER ***
Node    4: new patterns =    0 Obj Func Value = 3 INTEGER ***
Node    5: new patterns =    0 LP worse than integer incumbent 2.5 >= 2. Fathom node. 

Branch and bound tree exhausted.

 # Solution Report # 

Best integer obj. func. value = 2
Pattern count =    1:  2000 x  3, 
Pattern count =    1:  2000 x  1,  1000 x  4, 

# Total runtime = 0 Secs

[End Testcase]

To solve subproblem using GLPK glp_int, instead of DP, new commandline option 
--subintopt (--si) is introduced.

$ cspsol --subintopt -d o1.txt

To use option --wa, you must use patched GLPK lib which allows -ve tol_obj.

$ cspsol --subintopt --wa -d o1.txt

Type 'cspsol --help' for viewing changed help information.

Date: Thursday, 14 August 2008. Version 0.4 Released.

This release contains a workaound to solve issue described here:
http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/issues/detail?id=1

Workaround is disable by default. To enable use of commandline flag
--wa is needed.

Workaound is dependant on following code change in GLPK source code.

Comment out following segment of the code in GLPK, compile and build.
Function: int glp_intopt(glp_prob *mip, const glp_iocp *parm)
File: glpapi08.c
if (!(0.0 < parm->tol_obj && parm->tol_obj < 1.0))
	xfault("glp_intopt: tol_obj = %g; invalid parameter\n",
						parm->tol_obj);


# Example

$ cat o1.txt 
6000
2000 4
1000 4

$ cspsol --wa --data o1.txt

# Total runtime = 0 Secs

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Monday, 31 March 2008. Version 0.3 Released.

1. Now CG is done only at the root node of BB tree. CG at all nodes of
BB tree requires some more thought.
2. Removed slack variables, instead added trivial patterns to the
master problem. (as Andrew suggested.)
3. Now order width can be integer/float.
4. Improved formatting etc.
5. Moved files INSTALL and README from /src to parent dir.
6. Updated homepage http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Sunday, 30 March 2008. Version 0.2 Released.

Added some command line options. Added support for two search
strategies (DFS and BFS).

$ cspsol --help

Usage: cspsol [options...] --data filename

Where filename contains orders data in following format.
maximum_pattern_width
order_width_1 demand_1
order_width_2 demand_2
order_width_n demand_n

All demand quantities are <= maximum_pattern_width.

Options:
--dfs           Process branch and bound tree in depth first manner.
--bfs           Process branch and bound tree in breadth first manner.
-h, --help      Display this help information and exit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: Saturday, 29 March 2008. Version 0.1 Released.

Following mail posted on GLPK mailing list announcing version 0.1.

"I wrote a program to solve cutting stock problem. Program is written
in C++ and uses GLPK C API.  Customized branch & bound (BB) algorithm
is used. Each node of BB tree is a LP. Each node LP is solved using
column generation (CG). Very simple branching on fractional variable
is used to obtain integer solution. BB tree is traversed using breadth
first search (BFS) strategy.

Hopefully program will be useful to anyone interested in learning GLPK
C API and understand column generation technique. In case you want to
have a look at the source code, following web-page has more details,
including source code:

http://code.google.com/p/cspsol/

I have not tested the program extensively. It is likely that program
has some flaw or incorrect use of GLPK C API. Your feedback/comments
are welcome."
